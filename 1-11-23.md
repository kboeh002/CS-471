# [Operating Systems](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~price/cs471/notes/01.html)
* **OS:** A program that acts an an intermediary between a computer user and the computer hardware and software
## Unix Tangent...
### Layered Operating System
* Unix came in source code
* Allows you to change it to meet your needs
** INSERT DRAWING HERE **
* nothing has direct access to the hardware
* theoretically if you change the hardware the *only thing you have to change is the kernel*
* Layered Operating System is the basis of every operating system
* Apple's OS is unix
    * Unix traditionally doesn't have a user interface
* MIT wrote the first UNIX GUI called x-Windows
 
 * profiler
## Functions of OS
* **Resource Manager:** traditional view due to expense of computers
    * Manages: hardware, programs, data, *kernel*
    * Concerns: 
        * Utilization. performance (efficiency concerns and conflicting requests)
        * Accounting (who's using what and how much)
        * Security: Protects users from one another, OS from user erros or malicious activity
### Productivity Enhancement
* Productivity Enhancement
    * costs reduced
    * new activities enabled (devices/approaches/capabilities)
        * eg. `make` command in Unix
* Audiences: Programmers, end users, devices (eg. cars, planes, computers)

* Error Types: syntax errors, run time errors, and logic errors

## OS Tasks
* Security- to protect resources and users from both accidental and intentional intrusions
* Process management
* File system organization
* Communication
* Memory management
* **Mutual Exclusion:** in management of shared resources, OS often must allocate resources to at most one user at a time

## Next Class
* we will take a GUI apart
* go over User Interfaces more
