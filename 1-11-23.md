### Layered Operating System
* Unix came in source code
* Allows you to change it to meet your needs
** INSERT DRAWING HERE **
* nothing has direct access to the hardware
* theoretically if you change the hardware the *only thing you have to change is the kernel*
* Layered Operating System is the basis of every operating system
* Apple's OS is unix
    * Unix traditionally doesn't have a user interface
* MIT wrote the first UNIX GUI called x-Windows

* **Resource Manager:** traditional view due to expense of computers
    * Manages: hardware, programs, data, *kernel*
    * Concerns: 
        * Utilization. performance (efficiency concerns and conflicting requests)
        * Accounting (who's using what and how much)
        * Security: Protects users from one another, OS from user erros or malicious activity
### Productivity Enhancement
