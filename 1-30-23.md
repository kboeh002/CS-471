[scheduling](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~price/cs471/public_html/spring17/lectures/Scheduling.html)

* **Direct Assignment:** done with separate queues for each process type
    * eg. 50% of CPU to interactive processes, 20% of CPU to batch processes, 30% of CPU to real time processes
* Multilevel feedback queues: 
* Scheduling algorithm optimization criteria
    * maximize CPU utilization
    * maximize throughput
    * minimize turn around time
    * minimize waiting time
    * minimize response time
* First Come, First Served Scheduling (FCFS Scheduling): displayed with a gant chart
*Need to know how to do a Gantt Chart*

[Real time scheduling](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~price/cs471/notes/05.html)

* real times systems must give priority to real time processes
    * eg. singing birthday card
* real time scheduling is minimal
* some system calls are fairly "long"
* may of the system calls are written differently with interupts

single and miltithreaded processes
https://www.cs.odu.edu/~price/cs471/public_html/spring17/lectures/threads.html
* each thread is a way through; you can switch threads
    * threads are refered to as light weight processes
    * the same process is much less overhead with multithreaded processes than single
* if the system can switch to another thread of the same process then it will switch, otherwise it will block it
* the operating system makes decisions and may choose to jump out of the process even though other threads are available and switch for a heavy overhead
* switching does not affect the time slice for the whole process

*Example drawing with time axis going downward; single left, multi right*

* block list entity-> compute -> block list entity -> compute -> final block list entity
* tendancy to put things that are going to be blocking (I/O stuff) in its own threads to try to speed up what is going on

*contact switching* https://www.cs.odu.edu/~price/cs471/notes/07.html

* a particular kernal thread can be pinned to a particular CPU

* the operating system figures out what it needs to do to affect the communication between processes

*next drawing with list of words and arrows*

* stateless environment so the files are not damaged with means its slow

* TCP--- communications is part of the operating systems job so it knows when to use it
* GUI events- button press, key press
    * you can hang a data strucutre called a property on a window you make
    * property notify: changes the data structure in the property on the window and sends a update to the process
* sockets- general purpose communications; employ TCP if you are crossing a network
    * socket.h : you read from and write  (two way communication) to a socket and then close it using TCP as a basis; block oriented mechanism, a chunk that is sent
    * used for every windowing environment OS on the face of the earth
    * object oriented- leaky bucket (IMG)
* Constant rate data- audio video
